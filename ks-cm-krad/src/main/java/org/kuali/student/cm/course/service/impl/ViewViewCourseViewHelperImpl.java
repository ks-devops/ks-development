 * This is the view helper service used at Course Detailed view. To avoid code duplication and proposal review
 * and course view are pretty much same, we're extending from <class>CourseMaintainableImpl</class>
 * to retrieve the course information and populate all the information to the <class>ReviewProposalDisplay</class>,
 * which is the one being used by course view and proposal review as the model to display all the information at the ui.
 * The down side of this approach is we're using a <class>Maintainable</class> at the regular view but it's really
 * worth as it's not going to cause any issues and we're avoiding a lot of code duplications.
